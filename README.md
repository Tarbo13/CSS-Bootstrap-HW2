# Project Discription

Welcome to my updated portfolio page.  I initially created this page six weeks ago.  Using Bootstrap I created a responsive site that was basically a template for what was to come.  After six weeks of classes I now have the tools to create a more complete page with links to professional sites, my resume, and projects.  I used CSS and JavaScript to style the page.  Contact information has been added with a more targeted layout that better presents me to future employers.
